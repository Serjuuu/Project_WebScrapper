      Backend tools:
        1. Python: The primary programming language for building the scraper.
        2. Selenium: Automates browser interactions to dynamically load web content.
        3. BeautifulSoup: Parses HTML and extracts required data elements.
        4. Pandas: Structures and manages extracted data into a tabular format.
